    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>While searching the internet for an easy to use CRM for my computer business I came across MyITCRM which seemed great and I used it for a while before contributing to the development of it. After a while the development of MyITCRM came to a standstill and I just carried on using the last version (v2.9.3) which I had found to have many bugs but was still easy to use.</p>
    <p>Eventually I looked at the code and decided to fully rework the software as fixing it was not possibly. There was no logical structure to the code and most of the software packages used were seriously out of date and lastly etting hold of the developer was not possible, so QWcrm was born.</p>
    <p>QWcrm was based on the software MyITCRM but there is none of the MyITCRM code left, everything has been rewritten or replaced.</p>
    <p>Throughout the development I wanted to keep QWcrm easy to use just as it's predecessor for the end user, but I modernised the codebase to be modular and easy to understand. This means future development of QWcrm is very easy for such things as fixing security holes or adding new features.</p>
    <p>QWcrm will always be easy to use, this is it's strength. I designed this not only for me but for small business who cannot afford accounts and do not need to pay for complicated accountancy packages.</p>
